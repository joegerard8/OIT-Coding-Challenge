This challenge took me about 4 hours to complete. It was rather difficult, because I had never done anything like this before. 
While I wrote all of the code myself, honestly, I used ChatGpt to debug when I ran into an issue. The specific issue I ran into had to do with checking if the user or computer had a winning combination. I wasn't sure how to check if a list contained all the characters found in an embedded list.
I would have likely continued to try to solve it on my own, however, I am working a golf tournament pratically all day Tuesday, the 6th and Wednesday the 7th, and I wanted to get this done. 
Thanks.
